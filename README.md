Frequent Pattern Growth Algorithm

FP-Growth (frequent-pattern growth) algorithm is an improved algorithm of the Apriori algorithm put forward by Jiawei Han and so forth. 
It compresses data sets to a FP-tree, scans the database twice, does not produce the candidate item sets in mining process, and greatly improves the mining efficiency. 
But FP-Growth algorithm needs to create a FP-tree which contains all the data sets. This FP-tree has high requirement on memory space.
